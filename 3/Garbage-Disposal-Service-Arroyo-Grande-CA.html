<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
