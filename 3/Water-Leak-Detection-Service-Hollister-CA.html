<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then go back to service. Because they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
