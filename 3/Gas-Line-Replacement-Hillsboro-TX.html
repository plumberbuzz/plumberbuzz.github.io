<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
