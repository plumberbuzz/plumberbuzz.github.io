<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job because of the age of your house and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
