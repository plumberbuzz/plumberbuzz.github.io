<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Laveen AZ</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>
