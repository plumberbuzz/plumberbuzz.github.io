<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is particularly prudent to organize inspections on an annual basis and when acquiring a new house. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are germs that feed upon organic matter, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This natural service is safe and effective. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to acquire our recommended enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand manipulated on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the service technician to accurately analyze conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The details we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the very best service as well. If the pipe requires to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the perfect suggestion with self-confidence.</p>

The total cost to repair your bathroom or kitchen sink will mostly depend on the kind of problem you're experiencing, any parts needed to repair them, and the extent of the damage to your component and plumbing.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, joists, and floorings.

An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
