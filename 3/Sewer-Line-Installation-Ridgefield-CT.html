The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to restore the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain because they typically include grease and fat.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
