<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
