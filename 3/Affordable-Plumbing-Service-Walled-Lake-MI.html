<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
