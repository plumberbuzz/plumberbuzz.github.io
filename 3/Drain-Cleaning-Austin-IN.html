The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
