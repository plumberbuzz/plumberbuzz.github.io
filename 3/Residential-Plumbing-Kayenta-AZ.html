<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component. Running out of hot water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>If it gradually drains away as you work, add more hot water. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a new approach. Tankless units link straight to your plumbing and just heat the water as it is required. This results in cost savings on your energy bill.
