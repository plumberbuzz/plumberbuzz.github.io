Most of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
