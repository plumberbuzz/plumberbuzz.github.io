<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
