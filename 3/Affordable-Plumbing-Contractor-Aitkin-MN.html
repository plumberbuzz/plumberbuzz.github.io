It is very hard to judge such claims, which are almost never ever based on tests that are well enough described to allow others to examine them and to confirm the outcomes. While the lack of "clinical" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one be reluctant to accept it without some warranty of performance.</p>

<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and may sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is really a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home. As soon as the brand-new salt has actually had an opportunity to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
