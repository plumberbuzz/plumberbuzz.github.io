<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Bohemia NY</h3>
<p>This type of valve is used on agricultural areas. It is meant to keep the local water supply clean in the presence of various farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. The use of these items is called chemigation. There are a number of parts to this valve. The check valve has a spring operated flapper, which allows flow in only one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last element is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are introduced to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or static flow condition might cause annoyance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
