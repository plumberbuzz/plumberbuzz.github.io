<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
