If the motor spins freely, inspect that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button.

If the area is thought about a restricted area, correct security precautions should be followed for proper entry. A proper and safe  workplace might involve the positioning of safety barriers or entry restrictions around the workspace so the repair service technician or the public around your work area are not hurt. This could impact the technician's capability to effectively complete the repair if the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area.</p>
