You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual flow, taste, color or odor. A plumbing professional can identify whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature level or pressure might need replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

After all, excessive pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with dysfunctional water appliances.</p>
