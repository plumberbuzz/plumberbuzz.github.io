<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
