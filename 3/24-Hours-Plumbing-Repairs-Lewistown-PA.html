<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many construction contractors (or their employees). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently removing firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
