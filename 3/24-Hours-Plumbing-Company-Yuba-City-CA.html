<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
