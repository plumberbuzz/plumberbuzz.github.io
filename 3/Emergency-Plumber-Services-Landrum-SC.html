<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
