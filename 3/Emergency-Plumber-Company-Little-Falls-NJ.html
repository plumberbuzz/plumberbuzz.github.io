If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
