<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
