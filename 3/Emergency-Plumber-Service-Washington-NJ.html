<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Washington NJ</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
