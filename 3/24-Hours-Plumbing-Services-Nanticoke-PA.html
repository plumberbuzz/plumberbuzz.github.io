Checking the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be severe problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house should have water.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

Whether you need aid with a small repair, a remodel or a re-pipe, you can ensure that the work will be completed the very first time precisely.
