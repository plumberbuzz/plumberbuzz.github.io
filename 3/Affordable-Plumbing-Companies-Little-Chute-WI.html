Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust.</p>
