For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly.

We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
