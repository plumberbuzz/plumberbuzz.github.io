<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber might utilize one or a mix of piping material throughout your home repiping project. Copper is basic due to the fact that it's lasting, can endure fires, and resists weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which implies higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which suggests plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves time and money and reduces the danger of joint leakages.
