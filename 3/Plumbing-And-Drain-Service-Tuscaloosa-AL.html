<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
