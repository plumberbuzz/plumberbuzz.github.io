<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
