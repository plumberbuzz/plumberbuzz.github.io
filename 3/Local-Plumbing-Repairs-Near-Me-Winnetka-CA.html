<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of keeping the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace firmness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.
