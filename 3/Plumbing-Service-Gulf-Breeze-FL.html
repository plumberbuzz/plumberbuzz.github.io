<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old.

This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Everybody who's set up a couple of disposals knows this mistake: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout before hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you have actually replaced the flapper, the problem may be bigger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its ability to seal effectively, creating waste and a greater water expense.</p>
