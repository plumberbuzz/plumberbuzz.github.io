<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to consider.

Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
