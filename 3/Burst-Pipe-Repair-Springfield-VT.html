<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
