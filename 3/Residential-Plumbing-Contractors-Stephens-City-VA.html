<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Stephens City VA 22655</h3>
<p>If you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has begun to leak, very first consider your alternatives. A complete sewer pipe replacement might not be essential.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>
