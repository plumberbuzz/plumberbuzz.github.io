<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.

Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
