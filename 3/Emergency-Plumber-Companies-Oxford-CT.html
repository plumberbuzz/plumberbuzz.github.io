Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

He noted that there are certain impurities that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can assist alleviate those problems. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste.
