<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are certain impurities that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can assist alleviate those problems. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
