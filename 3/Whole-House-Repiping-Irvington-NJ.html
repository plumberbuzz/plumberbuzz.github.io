<p>One typical method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread tremendously. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific homes, it likewise prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
