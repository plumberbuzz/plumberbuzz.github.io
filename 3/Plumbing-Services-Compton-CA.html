<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
