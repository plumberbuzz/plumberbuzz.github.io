<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
