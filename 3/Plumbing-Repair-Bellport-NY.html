<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely unusual cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
