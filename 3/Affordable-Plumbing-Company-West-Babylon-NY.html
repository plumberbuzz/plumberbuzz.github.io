As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils.
