<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become worn out and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater very rapidly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
