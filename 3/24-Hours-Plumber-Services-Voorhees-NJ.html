<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Voorhees NJ</h3>
<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than simply a costly repair-- they can lead to costly and comprehensive home damage and result in serious health threats.

Fortunately, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a residence is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and pretty cheap to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, ultimately triggering a backup. This included with other debris in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
