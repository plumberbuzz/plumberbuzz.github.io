<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of preserving the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other crucial component needed to make the procedure work: a resin bed including great deals of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
