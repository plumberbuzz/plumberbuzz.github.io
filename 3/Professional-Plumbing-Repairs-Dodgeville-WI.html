The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to schedule yearly inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you understand that you have a history of leaking or blocking. Test.
