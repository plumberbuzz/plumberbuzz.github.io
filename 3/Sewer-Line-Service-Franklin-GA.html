<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Franklin GA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the issue. You may have to check out using a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products utilized by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both use numerous advantages and benefits such as removing the metal taste from your water.</p>
