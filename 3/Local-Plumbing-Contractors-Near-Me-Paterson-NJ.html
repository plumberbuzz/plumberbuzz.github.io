When connecting the water lines, solder the copper fittings before you screw them to the tank so you don't heat the tank itself while soldering (Photo 5).</p>
<p>CALL Nicor Gas at 888. Nicor4U (888.642.6748) and emergency responders at 911 once you are in a safe location, away from the area of the suspected leak.
