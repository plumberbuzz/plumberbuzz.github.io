Grease: Never ever put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than removing, these products often harden to form nasty obstructions, which you may need a plumber to remove.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Lots of scattering systems already have the correct backflow preventer installed and need just be evaluated yearly. Others may not meet state and local policies and might need to be replaced with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
