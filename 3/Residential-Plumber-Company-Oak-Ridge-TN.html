<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
