These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Backflow Preventers are a vital part of any plumbing project with the function of keeping drinkable water different from any possible risks through various applications.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
