<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
