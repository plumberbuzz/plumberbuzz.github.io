<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
