<h3>Faucet Repair in Whitehouse Texas</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.
