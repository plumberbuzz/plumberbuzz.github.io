<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
