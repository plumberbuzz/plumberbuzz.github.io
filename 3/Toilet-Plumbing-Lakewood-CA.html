<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
