<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
