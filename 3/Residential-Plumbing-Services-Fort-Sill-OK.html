<p>Irreversible magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based on a range of claims concerning their impact on water solidity and associated scale development. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has actually not had the ability to determine requirements for these items and report inconsistent efficiency to date.

<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
