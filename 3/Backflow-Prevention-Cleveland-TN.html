<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Reduced to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where solidity mineral ions are become a stable crystalline form that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regrowth.</p>
<p>Many homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their dirty or clogged drain issues.
