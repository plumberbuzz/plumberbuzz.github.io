<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
