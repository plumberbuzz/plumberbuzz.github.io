<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
