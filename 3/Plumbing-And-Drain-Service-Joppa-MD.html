<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Joppa MD</h3>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water main. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
