You most likely do not want to collect your patio area, parking lot or landscape.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing annual forward flow tests are sometimes viewed as a required to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
