<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house.

In your home, so much water cleans through the drains, as well as dirt, particles, hair, and other particles. In time, this can all build up. At first, you might not discover that your drains are moving slower, but after time, they will ultimately stop draining completely, which is when, you need the aid of a professional.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you've tried to repair them require professional support. Continued efforts on your own can harm your lines, and you may have a more major underlying issue than you understand.
