<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
