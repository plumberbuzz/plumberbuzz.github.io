<p>Lots of buildings are closed to the general public or have actually restricted access in order to help slow the spread of COVID-19. To prevent Legionella development, these systems should be actively handled and kept. When there is a big drop in building water usage, see details and guidance to reduce Legionella development and other pathogen and rust issues that occur.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

When a Notification of Correction" or Notice of Requirement" is released, failure to install or fix an installation and after that evaluate a backflow assembly might lead to service disruption or termination.</p>
