While a garbage disposal is a helpful tool, not all food waste can be put through a garbage disposal, causing obstructions. Some products that ought to never ever be put into the disposal consist of fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis.

Rotate the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
