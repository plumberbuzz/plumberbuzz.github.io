<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
