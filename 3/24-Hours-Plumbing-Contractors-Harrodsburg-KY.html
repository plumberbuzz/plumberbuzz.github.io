<p>Water temperature level concerns can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can merely loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
