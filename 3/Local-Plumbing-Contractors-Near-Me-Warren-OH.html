<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
