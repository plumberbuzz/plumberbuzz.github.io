<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
<p>Difficult water can leave your hair looking dull and dry and your skin feeling scratchy and flakey, and that's only what it does to your body.
