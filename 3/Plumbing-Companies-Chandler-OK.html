It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
