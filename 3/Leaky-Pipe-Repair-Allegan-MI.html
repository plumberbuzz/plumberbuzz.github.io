<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
