<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>

The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
