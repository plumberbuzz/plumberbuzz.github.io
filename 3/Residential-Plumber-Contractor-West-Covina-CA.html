<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during construction of a new or refurbished structure is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. Nevertheless, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause damaging damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>
