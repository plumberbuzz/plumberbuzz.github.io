<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Fishers IN 46038</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
