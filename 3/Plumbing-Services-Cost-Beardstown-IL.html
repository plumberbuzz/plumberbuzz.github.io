<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

One can be included for around $120 if you do not have one currently installed nearby.
