<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
