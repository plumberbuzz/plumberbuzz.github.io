<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
