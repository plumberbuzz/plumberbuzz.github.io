<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow.
