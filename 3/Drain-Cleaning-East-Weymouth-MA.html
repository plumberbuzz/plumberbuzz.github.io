That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
