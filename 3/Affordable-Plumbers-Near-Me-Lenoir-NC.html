<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both.
