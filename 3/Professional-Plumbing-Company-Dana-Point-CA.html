<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.

<p>When the pressure in a private water system exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger normal circulation to reverse, backpressure takes place.

Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
