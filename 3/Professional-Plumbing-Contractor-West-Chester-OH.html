<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
