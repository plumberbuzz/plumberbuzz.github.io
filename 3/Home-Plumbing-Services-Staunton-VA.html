<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively since hard water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more cleaning agent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
