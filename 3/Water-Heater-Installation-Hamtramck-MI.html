<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
