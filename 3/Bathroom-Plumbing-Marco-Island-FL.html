<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
