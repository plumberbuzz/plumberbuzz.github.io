<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Columbus IN</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
