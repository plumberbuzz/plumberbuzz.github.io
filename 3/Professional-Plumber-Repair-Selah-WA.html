<p>If a cable has not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time in advance, signing up with the cable television to the wires in the box just before or simply after installing the disposer.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
