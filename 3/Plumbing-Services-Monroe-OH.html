<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>It helps to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The trademark name is usually on the bowl behind the seat.

Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
