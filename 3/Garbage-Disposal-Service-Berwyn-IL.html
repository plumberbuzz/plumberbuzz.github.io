<p>Long-term magnetic water conditioning gadgets have been marketed based upon a variety of claims concerning their effect on water firmness and related scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has actually not been able to identify requirements for these items and report inconsistent performance to date. Research study has revealed no change occurs in the chemical and physical homes or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the devices (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
