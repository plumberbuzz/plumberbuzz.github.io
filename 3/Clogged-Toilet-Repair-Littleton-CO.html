<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each component. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
