<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would generally cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become broken and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater very quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a couple of options if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption. The other is to proceed and replace the entire line. Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable choice to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an option.</p>
