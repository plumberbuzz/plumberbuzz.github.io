<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>Offer Edwards & Mills, Inc., a call at (336) 299-6309 or send us an email for suggestions, info, or to set up an appointment for us to install your new kitchen sink. Our skilled, knowledgeable staff are here to provide a service for any plumbing or gas-related need you may experience in the Greensboro, NC area. AVB's can be plastic or brass and either electrical or manual. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are set up on each zone of the watering system, immediately after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
