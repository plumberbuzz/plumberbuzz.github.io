There is one more device Hose Vacuum Breaker (HVB) which should be set up on all garden hose bibs to prevent polluted lawn water being sucked in to the drinking supply of water network. It is a small brass unit that can be directly threaded on to the hose bib.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
