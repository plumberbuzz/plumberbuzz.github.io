<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply decades of security. There are many regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature level can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are fixed regularly. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
