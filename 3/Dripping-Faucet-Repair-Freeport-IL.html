Throughout regrowth, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally directed elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in.
