<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
