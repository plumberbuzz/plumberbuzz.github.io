<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Experts Given That 1938. As soon as once again, you can use your wrench to tighten up the lock bolt, but moving it in a clockwise direction. If the trap continues to leak, take it out completely and clean it thoroughly. You can decide to clear the drain with the help of an auger if you believe a clog. If your sink is blocked, water will drain extremely slowly; taking from a minute or more, to even 10.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
