<p>Galvanized steel drinkable water supply and circulation pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely utilized today for new building residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably costly, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements usually discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
