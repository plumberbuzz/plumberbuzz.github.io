<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
