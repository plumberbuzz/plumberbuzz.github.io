<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
