Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is recommended. The energy performance of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Element (EF).

The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
