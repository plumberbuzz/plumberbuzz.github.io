<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
