<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with most house owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.

<p>You have to invest at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a resilient finish mechanism.

The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
