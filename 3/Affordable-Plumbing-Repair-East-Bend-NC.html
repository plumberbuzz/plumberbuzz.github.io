<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You have permanent water hardness if you do not see limescale build-up however instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as effectively or your skin getting itchy and sensitive. If you smell gas, do not try to find the leak. Rather, leave your house or building right now. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, home appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge could develop a trigger. When you are in a safe place, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its high price makes it impractical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in some cases, include phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
