<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to examine. You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
