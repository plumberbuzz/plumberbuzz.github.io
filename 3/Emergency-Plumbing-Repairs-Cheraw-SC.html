<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it too.</p>
