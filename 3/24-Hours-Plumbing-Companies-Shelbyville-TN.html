<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Protection Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily available, natural gas pipes ranging from the gas meter to your natural gas devices. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they do not wear out as quickly.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection provides inspection services for all industrial and commercial buildings, and confirms compliance with the electrical code. The intent of electrical inspection is to guarantee compliance with the relevant electrical code in order to lower individual, and structural electrical dangers. First call your local energy company then call a plumber if you suspect a gas leak. Licensed professional plumbers will find and repair the gas leak, supply authorizations, and coordinate with the city for final inspections. An utility company will detect if there is a gas leak, however they do not find the source of the leak or repair it.</p>
