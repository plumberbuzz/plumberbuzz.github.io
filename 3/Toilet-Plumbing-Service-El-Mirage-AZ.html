<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary material utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it normally catches rust after about 50 years and requires replacement.

<h3>Frozen Pips in El Mirage Arizona</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>A plumbing permit shall include a statement directing that all work will be performed in accordance with the building and construction documents submitted and accepted as part of the application.
