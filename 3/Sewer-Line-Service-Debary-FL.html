<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is wrong with your hot water heater, as well as what maintenance work requires to be performed moving on. Water softeners generally use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from liquified salt chloride salt, likewise called salt water. In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble damp sand.</p>

Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened.
