<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to view what you put down your garbage disposal.
