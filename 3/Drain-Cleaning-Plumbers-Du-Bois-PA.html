<p>However, UPC design code needs stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to achieve the very same level of protection as a commercial system. Increased security is also required when chemicals are added to a fire defense system supplied by a drinkable water supply. Advise them to avoid hanging on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have kids. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
