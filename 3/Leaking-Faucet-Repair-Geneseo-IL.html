<p>Plastic pipe is a commonly used material because it is lightweight and flexible. Its seamlessness makes it a great product for installation in unsteady environments.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
