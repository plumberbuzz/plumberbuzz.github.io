<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping.

I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
