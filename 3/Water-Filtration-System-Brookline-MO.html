First, plans for each device to be installed must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to approve and process. Turned down plans should be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with safeguarding people's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source readily available to achieve that objective. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome indicate that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high threat protection level.</p>
