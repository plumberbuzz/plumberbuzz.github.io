<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
