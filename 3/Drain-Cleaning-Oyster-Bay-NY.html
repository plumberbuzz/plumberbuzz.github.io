<p>Many homeowners think their energy companies or property owners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that oftentimes you, the property owner, are accountable. A lot of fundamental property owners insurance coverage and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your house.</p>

The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
