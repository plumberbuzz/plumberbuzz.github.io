<p>If owner chooses to keep well, it should meet the existing code requirements and have a working pump and faucet. For more information, get in touch with the Well and Septic Division at (937) 225-4428. If owner picks to abandon the well, the well will need to be inspected. A permit for inspection might be acquired from the Well and Septic Department at (937) 225-4428. It is encouraged that you contact your local water purveyor for their requirements.</p>
<p>Transforming your home to natural gas, or if the existing line is at capability, you'll need to install a new gas line from the street to your house. This is in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be installed. You'll have the disposer system, the sink-mounting assembly, an L-shaped tailpipe with mounting hardware, the sink stopper, and-- with some brands-- a special hex wrenchette" that is used both for installing the unit and for inserting into a hex hole in the disposer's underside when repair is needed to break free blockages.</p>
