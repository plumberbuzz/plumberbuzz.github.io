<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to solve the issue. Other times a more substantial option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
