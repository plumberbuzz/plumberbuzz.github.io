<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
