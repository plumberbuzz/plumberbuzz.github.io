For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
