<p>Spotty meals? All Waste disposal unit are not equal. We have actually worked with practically every kind on the market today. We understand that the type you choose depends upon your area, your cooking habits, your drain lines and your budget. Before you choose a brand-new disposal, give us a call.

<p>If you have a sewage-disposal tank, then you might incorrectly believe that you can not have a garbage disposal, and this is not true.

The plumber you hire to install the unit also impacts the total price for a new garbage disposal. The MDH also recommends NOT softening the cold water supply to your kitchen faucet or your outside hose connections. This will substantially decrease the quantity of salt in your diet and conserve you money by not softening water unnecessarily.</p>
