<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This large amount of garbage does not need to enter the trash bin if it can easily and rapidly be dealt with through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>
