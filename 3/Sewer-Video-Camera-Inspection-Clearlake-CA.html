<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Clearlake CA</h3>

Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
