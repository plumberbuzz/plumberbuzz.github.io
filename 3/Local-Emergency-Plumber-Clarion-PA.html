<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
