Which is why choosing a comfy, reliable toilet seat is extremely important. However, you have to ensure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't an excellent concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
