<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
