<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Otsego MI</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.

A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
