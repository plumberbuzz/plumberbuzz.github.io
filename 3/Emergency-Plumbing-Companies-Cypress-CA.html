<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of lowest pressure.

Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the formation of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
