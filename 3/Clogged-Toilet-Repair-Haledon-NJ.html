<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten up as needed. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cords as desired.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
