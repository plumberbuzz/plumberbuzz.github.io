<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its high price makes it unwise as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in many cases, consist of phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
