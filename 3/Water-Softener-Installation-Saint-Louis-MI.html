<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not currently have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
