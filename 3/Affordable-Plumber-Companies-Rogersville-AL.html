<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
