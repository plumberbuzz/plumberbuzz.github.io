<p>Carbon monoxide gas is released when gas burns incompletely. The signs are the same as exposure to gas leak. The exposure to carbon monoxide is so deadly that anyone who inhales it requires immediate medical attention.

To avoid this disaster, make certain to use your gas ranges precisely as instructed and never ever to use them to warm your home. The very same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors just and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make certain someone is awake to monitor them.
