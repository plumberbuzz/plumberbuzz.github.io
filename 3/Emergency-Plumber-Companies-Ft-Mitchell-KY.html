<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
