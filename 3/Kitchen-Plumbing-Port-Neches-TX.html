If the area is considered a restricted area, correct security precautions need to be followed for correct entry. A safe and proper workplace might require the positioning of security barricades or entry constraints around the work area so the repair specialist or the general public around your work area are not harmed. If the backflow preventer is installed in a limiting area, this might impact the specialist's capability to effectively complete the repair.</p>

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
