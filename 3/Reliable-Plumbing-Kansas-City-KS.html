It is necessary that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
