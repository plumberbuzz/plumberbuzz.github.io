<h3>Sewer Pipe Repair in Granite City Illinois</h2>
<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
