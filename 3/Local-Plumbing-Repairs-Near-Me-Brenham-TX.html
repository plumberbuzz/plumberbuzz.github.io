<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
