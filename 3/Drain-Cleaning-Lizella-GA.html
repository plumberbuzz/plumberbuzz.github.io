Water pressure might be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
