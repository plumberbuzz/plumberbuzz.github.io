Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
