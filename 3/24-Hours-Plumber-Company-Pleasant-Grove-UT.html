<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
