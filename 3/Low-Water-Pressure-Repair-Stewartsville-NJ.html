A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
