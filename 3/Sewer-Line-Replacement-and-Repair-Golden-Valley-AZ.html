<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.

<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the first and main concerns that you must ask yourself. The age of your house is a critical component to understand whether or not you must repipe your house. This is not just due to the fact that your plumbing has aged with time, but also because homes that were built prior to a specific time period are more likely to contain galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we highly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades prior to that, possibilities are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimal rates.</p>
