<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
