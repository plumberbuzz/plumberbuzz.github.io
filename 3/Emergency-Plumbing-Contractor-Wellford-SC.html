<p>Many house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or filthy drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to utilize and economical, but they harm your pipes and their effects are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize extreme chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
