<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many building contractors (or their employees). The key to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
