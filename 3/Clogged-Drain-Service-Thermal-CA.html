<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
