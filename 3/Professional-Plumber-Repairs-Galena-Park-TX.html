The city or Uruk includes the oldest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had replaceable and quickly detachable segments, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
