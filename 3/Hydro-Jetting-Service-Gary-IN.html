They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>This is incredibly essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines.
