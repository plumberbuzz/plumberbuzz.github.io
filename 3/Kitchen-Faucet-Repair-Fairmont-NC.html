<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to obstructions that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will determine the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
