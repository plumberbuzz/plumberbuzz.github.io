Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
