<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Alpharetta GA 30022</h3>
<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you contact a qualified plumber if there is a consistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is extremely unsafe and can present major health threats.</p>

If they're required, your plumbing inspector will inform you.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
