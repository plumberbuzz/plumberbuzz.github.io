<p>Our commercial plumbers are concentrated on adding to the health, security and convenience of clients and their clients throughout the Illinois and Wisconsin region. Correct plumbing product or services are vital to any center's ability to operate effectively and beneficially.

<p>A clogged drain can cause a devastating leak in time. Do not wait until it's far too late! Trust our water leak detection solutions to fix your house's issues. Cooking Grease: Cooking grease should never be thrown down the kitchen drain. While it may go down as a liquid, as it cools it can end up being strong, finishing your pipes at the same time. It still remains sticky, however, which permits it to attract other debris, ultimately producing a massive blockage in your pipes.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to analyze. You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas water heaters, electric hot water heater and tankless water heaters. Carefully bend the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To adjust a float that does not have an arm, see Picture 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, broken flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the experts at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and reduce wasted water.</p>
