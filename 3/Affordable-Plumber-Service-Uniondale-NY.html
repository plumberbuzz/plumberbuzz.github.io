<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair at Uniondale NY 11553</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation of water which may bring dirty water or other, hazardous compounds into the general public water supply and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of scenarios that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is connected to any outdoors water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
