Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created due to the fact that of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
