<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.
