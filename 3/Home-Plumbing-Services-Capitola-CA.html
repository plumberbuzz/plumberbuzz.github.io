It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
