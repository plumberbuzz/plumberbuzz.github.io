<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
