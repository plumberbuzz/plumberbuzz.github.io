The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
