A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan created to avoid the turnaround of the flow of water once it has actually gone through the valve. The two kinds of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are two very various products, however they both have unbelievable sturdiness and durability.</p>
