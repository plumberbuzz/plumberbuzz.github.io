<p>Inspections prevent a high portion of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run appropriately. It is essential to make sure there is constantly 2 feet of clearance around it. You must also drain about 25 percent of your tank frequently (a couple of times each year). This will help get rid of any sediment that has actually settled inside the tank.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets are frustrating, and replacing them is an unwanted expense. Conserve money by repairing the faucet yourself. Is your water heater making noises or leaking water? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Cooling at (913) 432-3342 for professional Merriam hot water heater services. Often water backs up from clogged kitchen sinks. This can take place after the water has already blended with sewage water in other sections of your home's plumbing network.</p>
