I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
