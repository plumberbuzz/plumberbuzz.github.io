<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
