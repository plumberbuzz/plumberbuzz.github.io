If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
