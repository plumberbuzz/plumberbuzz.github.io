<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth learning about waste disposal unit installation. You count on your water heater every day for all the hot water you and your family need to prepare, clean, and bathe.

<p>Recent advances in toilet technology have made modern bathrooms even more comfy and functional. If your toilet was made before 1994, then it's most likely costing you cash every day.

Jeff Gorton, an editor at The Family Handyman, will reveal you how to get rid of and dispose of a water heater in our video tutorial. He will also reveal you the simple way to bring a water heater out of your house, even if you are working alone.</p>
