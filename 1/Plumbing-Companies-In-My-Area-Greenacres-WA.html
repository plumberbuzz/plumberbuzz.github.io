<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt.
