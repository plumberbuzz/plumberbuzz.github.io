<h3>Drain Cleaning Service in Lawrenceburg Tennessee</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public water system and private on-site water system and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between potable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
