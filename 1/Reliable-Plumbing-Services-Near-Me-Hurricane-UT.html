<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
