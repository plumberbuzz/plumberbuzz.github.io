Cooking Grease: Cooking grease must never be tossed down the kitchen drain. While it may go down as a liquid, as it cools it can end up being solid, covering your pipes at the same time. It still remains sticky, nevertheless, which enables it to attract other particles, eventually developing a massive blockage in your pipes.</p>
