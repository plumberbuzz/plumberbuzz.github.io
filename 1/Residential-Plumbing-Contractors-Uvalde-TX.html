<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
