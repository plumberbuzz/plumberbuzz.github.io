<p>Inspect the home's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated and offered for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust, demand that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
