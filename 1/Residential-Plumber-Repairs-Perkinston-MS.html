<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Perkinston MS</h3>

Some property owners will attempt to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, especially if you are handling a little drain clog. However, they are usually short-term fixes that do not provide permanent resolutions.</p>

<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Perkinston MS 39573</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
