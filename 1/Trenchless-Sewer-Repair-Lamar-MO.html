<p>Gas leakages are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that permits connections and disconnections of gas appliances.

If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and should immediately call a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in waste disposal unit installation make the task possibly hazardous.
