Because they can restrain the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never ever be put down the garbage disposal.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
