<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
