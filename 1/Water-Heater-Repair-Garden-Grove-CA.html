<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Garden Grove CA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly maintained. Making sure the salt water tank never lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>

Waste disposal unit are pretty simple to preserve. The most essential thing to keep in mind is that they are actually food disposals. Items that would otherwise go in the garbage needs to not be put in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires properly, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can attempt disposing a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that switch on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or exhausted, broken sink? No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing group does the job quickly and economically.</p>
