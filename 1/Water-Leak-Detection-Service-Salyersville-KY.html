<p>A garbage disposal ought to not leak. When this occurs, it generally indicates wear and tear which is a fair sign that its time is up.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
