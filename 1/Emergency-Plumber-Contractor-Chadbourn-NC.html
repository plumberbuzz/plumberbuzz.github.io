<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has actually been in location because your home was constructed so it is about the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
