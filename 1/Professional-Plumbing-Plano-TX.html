<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Plano TX 75025</h3>
<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most common indications that your unit is at completion of its life-span, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors.

Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
