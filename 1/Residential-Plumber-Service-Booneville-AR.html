The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
