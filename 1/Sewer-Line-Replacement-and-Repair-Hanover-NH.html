If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait till after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings.

<p>The normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections.

Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
