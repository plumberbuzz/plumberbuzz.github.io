<p>The more often a waste disposal unit is utilized (properly), the better it will grind food waste and resist rusting. You can keep odors away by grinding up orange or lemon peels inside it. Harder materials, like eggshells and fish bones, scour the disposal walls and help keep them clean also. It's a great concept to find a plumber that offers a detailed variety of plumbing services. Remember you desire a one-stop shop-- that is, one company you can call for your different plumbing needs.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
