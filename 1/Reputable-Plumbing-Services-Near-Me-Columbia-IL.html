Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most typical indications that your system is at completion of its lifespan, especially if they are triggering major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this could be an indicator that your water heater is rusting on the inside and might begin leaking soon.
