<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

To prevent this catastrophe, make sure to use your gas stoves exactly as advised and never ever to use them to heat your house. The very same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors just and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make certain somebody is awake to monitor them. Numerous households die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide gas poisoning overnight. Another preventative measure to take is to never ever run your generators in enclosed areas.
