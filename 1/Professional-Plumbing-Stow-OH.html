<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly required, in some cases the plumber may have to repair or update wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This generally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot light might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be blemished or degraded. Contact our professionals to determine the level of the problem.</p>
