<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
