<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
