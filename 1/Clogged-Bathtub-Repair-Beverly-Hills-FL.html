<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It usually symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you see low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>
