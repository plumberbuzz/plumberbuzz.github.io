<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
