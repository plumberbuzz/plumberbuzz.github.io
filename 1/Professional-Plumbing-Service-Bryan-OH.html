<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
