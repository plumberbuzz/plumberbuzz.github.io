<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
