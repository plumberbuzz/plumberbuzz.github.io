<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow.
