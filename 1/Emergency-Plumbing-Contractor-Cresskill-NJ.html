<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and minimized pressure zone assemblies.

When you connect the P-trap, also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
