The provider must get a permit prior to trenching. How frequently a backflow preventer needs to be checked depends on its type.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed properly (Picture 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
