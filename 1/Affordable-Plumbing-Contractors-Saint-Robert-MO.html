<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are added into gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
