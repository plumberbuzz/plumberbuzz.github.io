When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause damaging damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>
