<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with tough water, you might not realize just how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Tough water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
