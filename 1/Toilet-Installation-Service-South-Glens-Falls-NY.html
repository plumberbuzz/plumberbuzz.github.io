Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
