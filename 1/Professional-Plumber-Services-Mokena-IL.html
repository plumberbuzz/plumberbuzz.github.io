<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more detergent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and decontaminated during regeneration. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
