It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
