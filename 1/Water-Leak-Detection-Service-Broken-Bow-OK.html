<p>Hybrid tank-tankless water heaters make life simpler by offering you more hot water to satisfy your daily requirements. Much of us fall into a routine of preparing our lives around hot water without even understanding it. Thankfully, the hybrid tank-tankless hot water heater that we offer supply the best of both worlds. By installing an unit that resembles a standard tank hot water heater, you can experience warm water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in structures are linked effectively, without any cross-connection to contaminate drinkable water supply.

Warm water heaters are also inspected to ensure that they have actually been installed appropriately, to prevent a surge.</p>

Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who installs gas piping on property not under their ownership must have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a license and inspection.</p>
