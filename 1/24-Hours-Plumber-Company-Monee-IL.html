<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Location a container beneath the area to capture water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in location. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
