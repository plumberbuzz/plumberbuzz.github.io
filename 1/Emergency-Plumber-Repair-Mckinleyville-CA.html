<p>High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water coming into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water turned off valves and supply lines, and toilets.

<h3>Toilet Installation in Mckinleyville California</h2>
<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help remove them. If you would like to try the gentlest approach perhaps try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on.
