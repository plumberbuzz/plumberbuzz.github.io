<p>Clogged kitchen drains are one of the most common household drain clogs people handle. Help prevent regular drain clogs by having a waste disposal unit installed in your kitchen!

Whole-house repiping can certainly be a big endeavor, which is why the service is only performed when absolutely required.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
