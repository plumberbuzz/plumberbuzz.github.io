<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
