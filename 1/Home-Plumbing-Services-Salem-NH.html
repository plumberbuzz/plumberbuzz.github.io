<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.

We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
