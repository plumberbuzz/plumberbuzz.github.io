Difficult water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
