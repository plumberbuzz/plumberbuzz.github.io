<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
