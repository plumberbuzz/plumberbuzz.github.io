<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line blockages are not something a homeowner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain issue.

<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion.</p>

<p>Getting Rid Of a Waste Disposal Unit - $26 - $37 for labor. This includes the cost for a plumber or handyman to switch off the water, disconnect the drain, cap the lines, disconnect the faucets and fittings, eliminate the sink from the base cabinet, and pile the debris onsite. Many prospective house purchasers are requesting drain inspections before they buy a house. TLC's drain professionals are certified and experienced in carrying out drain and sewer line inspections for houses.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
