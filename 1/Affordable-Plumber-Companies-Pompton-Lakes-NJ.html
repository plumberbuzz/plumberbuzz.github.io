<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure.

Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized.
