<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of preserving the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you see strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking hot water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>

If you have tough water, your hair may feel dull and lack body, and your clothes will start to fade and may wear out earlier.
