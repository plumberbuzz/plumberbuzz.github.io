<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
