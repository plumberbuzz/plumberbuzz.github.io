Which is why selecting a comfy, well-crafted toilet seat is exceptionally important. However, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight evenly and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
