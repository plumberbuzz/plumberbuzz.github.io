<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
