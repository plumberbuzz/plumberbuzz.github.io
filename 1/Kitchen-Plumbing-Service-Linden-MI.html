<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.
