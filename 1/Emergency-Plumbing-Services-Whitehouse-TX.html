<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
