<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Stamford CT 06902</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
