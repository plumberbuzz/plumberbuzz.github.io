<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation in Delaware Ohio</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
