Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
