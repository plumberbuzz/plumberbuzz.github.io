<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
