It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
