<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
