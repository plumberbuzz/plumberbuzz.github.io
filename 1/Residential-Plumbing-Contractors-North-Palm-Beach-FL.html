<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you ought to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
