<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
