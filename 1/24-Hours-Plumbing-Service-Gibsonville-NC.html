<p>Fire department connections can be a concern when used in fighting a fire. Firemen by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about securing people's lives and to a lesser extent their property.

This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as a result indicate that the level of protection on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high risk defense level.</p>
<p>Among the important things we specialize in is the bathroom toilet. A lot of people and businesses let the toilet drainage year after year with leaking or inefficient models.
