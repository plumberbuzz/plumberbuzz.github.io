Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
