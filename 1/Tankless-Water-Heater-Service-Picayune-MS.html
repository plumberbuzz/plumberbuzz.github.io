<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside your home and underground, DCVs are a little bit more expensive but are also highly hassle-free, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in finding buried septic tanks or checking the condition of buried pipes to figure out proper maintenance schedules or the degree of needed repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still happen.</p>
