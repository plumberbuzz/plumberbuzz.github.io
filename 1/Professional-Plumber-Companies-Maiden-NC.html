<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
