<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Warehouse also carries a wide variety of backflow prevention devices. These accessories include backflow prevention system accessories, backflow device enclosures, test sets, repair parts, and insulated pouches. Nevertheless, if your water heater is over 10 years and is continuously having problems, a whole unit replacement is the more affordable alternative. It will be better to cope with a new, more effective unit than to invest in regular repairs.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify problem. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly useful in locating an issue.</p>
