<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs.

Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel drinkable water supply and distribution pipes are frequently found with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably costly, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.
