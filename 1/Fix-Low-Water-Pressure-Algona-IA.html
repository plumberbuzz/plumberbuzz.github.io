As rust and minerals develop gradually, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
