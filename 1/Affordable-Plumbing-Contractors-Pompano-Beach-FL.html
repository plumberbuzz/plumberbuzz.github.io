<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
