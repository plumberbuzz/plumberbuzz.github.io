Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively formed bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>

If the drains clog sometimes however you can usually flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small blockages can develop into big ones fairly quickly.</p>
