<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.
