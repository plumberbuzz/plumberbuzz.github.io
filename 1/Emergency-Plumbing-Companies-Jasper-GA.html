<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.
