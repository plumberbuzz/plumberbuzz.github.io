If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities.

It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).
