<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems.

There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
