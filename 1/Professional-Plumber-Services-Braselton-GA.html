<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
