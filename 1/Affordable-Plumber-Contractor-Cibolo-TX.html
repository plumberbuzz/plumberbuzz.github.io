<p>On and off does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is usually found before it causes any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to continually leak out very gradually. Over time it can result in a substantial build of water.

Watch out for several clogged drains in your house, overruning or supported toilets, or water stains on your walls and structure.</p>
