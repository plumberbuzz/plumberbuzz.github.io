<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.
