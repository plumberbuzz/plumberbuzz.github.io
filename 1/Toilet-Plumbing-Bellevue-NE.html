As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
