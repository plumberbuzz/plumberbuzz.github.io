Design - Once you include a 2nd floor and even third floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will utilize more materials which adds to your labor expenses.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
