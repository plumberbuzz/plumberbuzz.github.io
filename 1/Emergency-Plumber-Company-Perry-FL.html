<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.
