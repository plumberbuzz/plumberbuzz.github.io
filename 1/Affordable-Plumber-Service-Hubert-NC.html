<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>There are 2 broad classifications of sources of possible cross contamination: external and internal. Internal sources consist of the abovementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and devices such as meal washers, hot water tanks, glowing water heating systems, and so on. External sources include rain water run-off from roofings and car park, groundwater, puddles of surface water, hygienic sewer pipelines, other supply of water pipelines, septic systems, underground storage tanks and cisterns, watering pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, lawn sprinklers, farming run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost heap, buried or aboveground chemical storage tanks, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewage systems during heavy rainfall events into structure structures and basements.</p>
