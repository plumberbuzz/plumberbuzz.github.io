<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Colts Neck NJ 07722</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
