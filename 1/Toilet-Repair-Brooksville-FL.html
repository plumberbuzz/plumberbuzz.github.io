<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
