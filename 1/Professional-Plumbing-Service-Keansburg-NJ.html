<p>In this circumstance, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you notice your water has an uncommon flow, taste, odor or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complicated concerns with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this may operate in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same material as other pipes in your home, meaning that trouble could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you peace of mind and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>
