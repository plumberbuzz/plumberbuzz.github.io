Capability to Choose Media for Custom-made Applications - Ships without media to provide flexibility in supplying solutions for various problem water situations.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Converting your home to natural gas, or if the existing line is at capability, you'll need to install a new gas line from the street to your home. This remains in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be installed.
