<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including poor soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and corrosion.

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the general public water system from toxins and impurities that could, under certain situations, be drawn into the public water supply from personal properties.
