<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly unusual cases where the building is considered to not posture a danger to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
