<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Our team at All Phase Plumbing likewise utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation.

The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in location for numerous hours or 60 minutes. Once the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
