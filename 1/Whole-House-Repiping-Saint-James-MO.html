<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>11. Munn, P. (2012 ). Results from testing corrosivity of softened and difficult water in model central heating systems at BSI, Loughborough." Midland Corrosion Services Ltd. Like any other system that receives frequent, continuous usage, your house's pipes undergo regular wear and tear. Eventually, these pipes will need to be changed altogether. But, since they are hidden underground, behind walls, and tucked out of sight, it isn't always simple to inform when you need repiping.</p>

<p>If you experience obstructions and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a great idea to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

The camera can locate and identify the issue so the drain can be fixed.</p>
