<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Meridian MS 39301</h3>
<p>Very first consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be required. Typically, relining your existing pipes is a better option.

The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
