<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Wantagh NY</h3>
<p>Sinks must be considered like a machine. They use a variety of parts and gadgets that work together for the performance of a single sink. For example, a kitchen sink may include as many as 6 separate systems simply to supply the total service we expect. Like any machine, a sink has several parts that need repair and maintenance in time.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
