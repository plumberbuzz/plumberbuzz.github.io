Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
