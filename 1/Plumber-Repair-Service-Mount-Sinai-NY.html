<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
