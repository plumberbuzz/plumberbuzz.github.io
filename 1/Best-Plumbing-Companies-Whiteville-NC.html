Hard water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
