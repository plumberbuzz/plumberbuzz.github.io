<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
