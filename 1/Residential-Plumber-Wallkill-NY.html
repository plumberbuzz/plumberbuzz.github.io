The installation needs to be evaluated to ensure it does not circumvent the workings of the assembly. Test data need to be built up to figure out the workings of each component. The backflow prevention assembly need to be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be checked once again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow chart is required to ensure it was fixed effectively.
