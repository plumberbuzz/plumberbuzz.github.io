<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself at Pequot Lakes MN 56472</h3>
<p>When you get rid of the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But discovering the best washer may not be. The most common washers are frequently available at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be difficult to find. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
