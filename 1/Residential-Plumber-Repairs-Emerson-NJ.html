<p>Bear in mind that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you need to just work with a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs catch wetness so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
