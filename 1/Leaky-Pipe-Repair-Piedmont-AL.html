Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of firmness minerals and chloride that you may not desire just running outside. Not to mention plumbing code may be breached without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>

Tough water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
