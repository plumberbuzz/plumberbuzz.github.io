<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance.

Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
