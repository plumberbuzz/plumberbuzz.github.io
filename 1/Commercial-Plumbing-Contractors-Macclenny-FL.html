<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
