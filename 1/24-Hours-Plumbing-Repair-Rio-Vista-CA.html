<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
