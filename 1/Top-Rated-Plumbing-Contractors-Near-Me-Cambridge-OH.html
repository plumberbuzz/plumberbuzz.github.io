When drains are working properly that's really all you need to learn about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
