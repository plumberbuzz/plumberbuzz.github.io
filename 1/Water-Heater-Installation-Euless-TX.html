<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that happens in the earth's crust and is likewise sometimes formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
