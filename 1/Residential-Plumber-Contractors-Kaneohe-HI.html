A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.

<p>Tankless Hot water heater - supply hot water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing hot water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Because they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never ever be put down the garbage disposal.
