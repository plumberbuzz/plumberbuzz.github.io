<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
