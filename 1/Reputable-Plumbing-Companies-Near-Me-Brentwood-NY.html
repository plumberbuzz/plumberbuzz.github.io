Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
