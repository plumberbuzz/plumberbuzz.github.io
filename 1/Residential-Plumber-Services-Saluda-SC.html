<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component.

To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
