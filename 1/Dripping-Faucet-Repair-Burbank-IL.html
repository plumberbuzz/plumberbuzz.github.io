<p>Remember that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you should just work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch wetness so that it does not get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
