<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
