Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining component itself. Clogs in a component can cause detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
