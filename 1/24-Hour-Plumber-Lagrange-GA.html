<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a various design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into location. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected.
