<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection in between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
