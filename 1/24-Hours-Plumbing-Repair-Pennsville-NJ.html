<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>You probably understand something about your drains: they take water from your bath tubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment center. When drains are working correctly that's actually all you need to understand about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the proficiency to identify a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses developed to train experts to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
