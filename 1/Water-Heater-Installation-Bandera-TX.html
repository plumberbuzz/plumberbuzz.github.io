Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
