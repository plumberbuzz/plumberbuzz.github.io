<p>This is among the main and first questions that you ought to ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is an important part to understand whether you must repipe your home. This is not just because your plumbing has aged with time, but also due to the fact that homes that were built prior to a certain period are more likely to consist of galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is obsolete in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimal rates if your home was developed decades prior to that.</p>

It is hardly ever used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also exceptionally durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe material for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
