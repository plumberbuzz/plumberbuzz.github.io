Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
