<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
