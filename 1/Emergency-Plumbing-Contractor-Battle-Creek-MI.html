<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can occur in time from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
