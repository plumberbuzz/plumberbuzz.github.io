<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized.
