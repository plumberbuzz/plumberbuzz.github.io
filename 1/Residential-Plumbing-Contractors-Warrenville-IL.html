<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more detergent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
