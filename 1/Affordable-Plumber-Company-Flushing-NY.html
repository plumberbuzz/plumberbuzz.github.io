<p>Examine the home's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and available for use.

If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion, demand that a new one be installed.</p>
