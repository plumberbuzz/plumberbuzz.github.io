<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>Longstanding Obstructions: Blockages that continue after you've attempted to repair them require professional help.
