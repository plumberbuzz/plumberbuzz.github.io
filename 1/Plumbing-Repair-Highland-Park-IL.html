<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Highland Park IL 60035</h3>

In those circumstances, a repair could be needed as the drains have some amount of damage that may need a bit more work. Reach out to our Jonesboro drain service professionals today if you believe you might be in need of a repair.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
