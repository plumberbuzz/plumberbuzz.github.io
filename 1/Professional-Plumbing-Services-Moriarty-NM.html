<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>

Frequently handles are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back properly. It's a simple repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush deal with out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Photo 1). Then eliminate the old deal with and lever, slide the new handle into location, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
