<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
