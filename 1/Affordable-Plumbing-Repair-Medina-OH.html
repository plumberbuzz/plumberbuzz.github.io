<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
