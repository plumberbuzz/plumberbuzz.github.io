<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is usually spotted prior to it triggers any considerable damage. The water leak is usually the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to continually leak out very slowly. With time it can result in a significant build of water.
