<h3>Drain Clean Out in Spanaway Washington</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in homes, businesses, and factories.
