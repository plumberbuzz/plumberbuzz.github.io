Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
