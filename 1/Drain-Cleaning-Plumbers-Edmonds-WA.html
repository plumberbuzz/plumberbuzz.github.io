<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the major perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can create serious drain obstructions by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
