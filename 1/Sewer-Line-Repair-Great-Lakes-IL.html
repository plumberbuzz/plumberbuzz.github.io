<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
