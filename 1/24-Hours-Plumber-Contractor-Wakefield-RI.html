<p>Water firmness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
