<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Thurmont MD</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Was your home built before the 1970s and has not gone through renovation or pipe replacement? If so, it is most likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another product which has corroded and rotted over the years. Older pipes can cause significant leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>
