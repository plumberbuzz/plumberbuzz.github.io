<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

A clogged kitchen sink is typically a sign of a clog in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't gotten rid of, water pressure can develop within the pipe, ultimately causing it to burst.</p>
