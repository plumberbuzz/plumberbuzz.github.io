<p>Ron Steele Plumbing installs the greatest rated and # 1 toilets for our Charlotte area clients. Toto toilets are Made in the USA and consist of features many of our customers love. Soft-close covers and seating so there is no more slamming lids, dual-max flushing systems to prevent clogs permanently, and naturally WaterSense technology ensures you a green" and high efficiency water saving toilet for your home.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>If owner selects to keep well, it needs to fulfill the existing code requirements and have a working pump and faucet. For further information, call the Well and Septic Division at (937) 225-4428. The well will need to be examined if owner selects to abandon the well. A permit for inspection might be acquired from the Well and Septic Department at (937) 225-4428. It is advised that you contact your local water purveyor for their requirements.</p>
