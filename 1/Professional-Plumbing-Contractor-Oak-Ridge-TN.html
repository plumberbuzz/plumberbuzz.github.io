<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

Additionally, this repair work needs that you employ a licensed plumber It is imperative that gas work, installation, refitting and all other elements are done by qualified professional plumbing contractors.

<p>Low pH likewise increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to express the strength of the level of acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Carbon dioxide will potentially contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thus making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
