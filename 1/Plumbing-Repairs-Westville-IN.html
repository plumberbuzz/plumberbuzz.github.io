<p>Many homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their dirty or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to use and economical, however they harm your pipes and their results are only short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if using among these products.</p>
