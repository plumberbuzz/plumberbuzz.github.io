<p>Family ran and owned since 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing expertise, home renovating service, and hot water heater conversions and replacements to the higher Fort Worth, TX community. It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
