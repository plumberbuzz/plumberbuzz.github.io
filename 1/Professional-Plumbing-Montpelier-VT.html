<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation consultation. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water stick to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
