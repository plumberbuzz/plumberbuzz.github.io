<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
