<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
