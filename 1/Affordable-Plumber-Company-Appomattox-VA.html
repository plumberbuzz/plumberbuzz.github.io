<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it concerns pipe repair, the most costly factors aren't the equipment or materials utilized, but the lawn, landscaping and uprooting damage that takes place.</p>
