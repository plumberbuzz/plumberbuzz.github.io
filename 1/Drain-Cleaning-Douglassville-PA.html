Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Douglassville PA</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and easy to install, so there's no factor not to. Eventually causing a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water circulation. This added with other debris in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
