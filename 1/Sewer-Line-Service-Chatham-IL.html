<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable option, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
