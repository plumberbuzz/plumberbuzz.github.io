When no other source of a leak can be identified, it is safe to assume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will want to unscrew the drain, and clean it completely. If it is set in location, remove all of the previous plumber's putty by using a scraper.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
