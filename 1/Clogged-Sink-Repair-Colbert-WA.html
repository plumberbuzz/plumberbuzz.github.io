<p>You live in an older house. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old.

This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
