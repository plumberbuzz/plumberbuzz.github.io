<p>Sewer lines have one important role: bring wastewater out of a home or building. The majority of folks replace their water heaters due to bad performance, total failure or as a preventive measure. If your hot water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to think about changing it with a more efficient model. Water on the floor can imply used parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.
