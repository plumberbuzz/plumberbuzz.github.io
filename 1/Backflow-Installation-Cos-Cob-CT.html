Your backflow preventer stopped working the annual inspection and needs to be fixed or changed and re-certified within 1 month. Call a certified plumber instantly and have the plumber contact the Cross Connection Control office. Traditional tank hot water heater: These hot water heater are normally powered by gas or electrical energy. They hold 20 to 100 gallons of water, depending on the requirements of your household.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Double Check even though it might be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>The Plumbing Inspection Division is accountable for protecting the water supply by guaranteeing, through strategy evaluation and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are also accountable for ensuring the waste plumbing is properly vented and trapped so the plumbing safely brings waste away while triggering no health problems.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
