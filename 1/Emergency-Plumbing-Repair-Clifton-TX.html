<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
