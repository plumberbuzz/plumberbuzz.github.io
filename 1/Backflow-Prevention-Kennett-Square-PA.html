Galvanized steel (typically recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably pricey, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements generally found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
