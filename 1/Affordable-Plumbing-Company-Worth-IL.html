<p>If you have actually split or broken drains up until a video inspection is performed, it's hard to identify. Split or broken drains are normally preceded by repeating clogs, consistent foul drain odors or the existence of sewer flies. The initial step is attempt to clear the blocked drain and after that immediately inspect the drain. In many cases a smoke test can be carried out to reveal breaks or cracks. ZOOM DRAIN carries out a free peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
