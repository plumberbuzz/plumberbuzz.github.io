<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached.
