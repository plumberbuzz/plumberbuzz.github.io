<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will establish.

<p>If you have a garbage disposal, shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening any pipes or supply lines. Whole-house repiping can definitely be a large endeavor, which is why the service is just performed when absolutely required.

Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
