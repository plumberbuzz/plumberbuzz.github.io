<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
