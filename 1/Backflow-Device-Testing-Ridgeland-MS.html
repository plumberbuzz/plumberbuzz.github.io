<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas hot water heater, electrical hot water heater and tankless hot water heater. Carefully bend the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To adjust a float that doesn't have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the experts at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and lower lost water.</p>
