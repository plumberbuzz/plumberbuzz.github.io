<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high cost makes it impractical as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in some cases, contain phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
