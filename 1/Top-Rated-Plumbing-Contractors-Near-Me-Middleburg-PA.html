<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
