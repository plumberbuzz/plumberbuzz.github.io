You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, color, smell or taste. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.
