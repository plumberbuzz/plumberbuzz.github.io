<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In South Elgin IL</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
