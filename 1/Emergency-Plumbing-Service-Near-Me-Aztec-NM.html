<p>Unless you have a wily two-year old who loves to toss toilet paper down the toilet, you need to not have regular clogging problems. In fact, you should rarely have a clogged toilet if you are using it correctly and if it is working properly. If you are having a toilet that blocks continuously and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing on a regular basis, then it's probably time for a brand-new toilet. This may be an indicator that your toilet has a malfunctioning part or there is a various blockage in your sewer lines. In either case, you need to call us for a house plumbing inspection immediately.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>For instance, if your hot water heater is continuously breaking down and requiring repair, a brand-new unit will save you cash. Additionally, if you observe increasing energy bills from an inefficient system, you will also save cash with a brand-new installation. We recommend that all water heaters that are 10-15 years of ages be changed in order to save the house owner money and time in the future.</p>
