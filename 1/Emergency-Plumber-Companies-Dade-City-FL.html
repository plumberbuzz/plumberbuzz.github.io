<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter season freezing.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
