Which is why picking a comfy, well-made toilet seat is incredibly crucial. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly created to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and might eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
