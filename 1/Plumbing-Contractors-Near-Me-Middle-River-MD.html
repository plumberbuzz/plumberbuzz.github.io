<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening any pipes or supply lines. Whole-house repiping can certainly be a big undertaking, which is why the service is only performed when definitely essential. First, your plumber will decide which piping product to utilize for the job, either copper or plastic. Replacing and installing brand-new pipes can take anywhere between 3-5 days depending upon the size of your house.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
