<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.

The demand upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
