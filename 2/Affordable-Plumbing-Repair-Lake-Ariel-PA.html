<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
