<p>The most effective method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
