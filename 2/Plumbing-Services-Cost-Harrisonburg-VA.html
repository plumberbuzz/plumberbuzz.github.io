<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
