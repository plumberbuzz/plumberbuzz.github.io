<p>There are a variety of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last forever. It has remained in place considering that your house was developed so it is about the same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
