<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Nolensville TN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide 2 types of water treatment systems for tough water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
