The pink film is actually a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. Once the new salt has actually had a possibility to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
