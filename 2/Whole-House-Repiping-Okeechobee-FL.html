<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Okeechobee FL</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
