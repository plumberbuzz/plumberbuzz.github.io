When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a life expectancy of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly preserved. Making certain the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise secure the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and aid eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
