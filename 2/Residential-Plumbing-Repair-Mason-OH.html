<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
