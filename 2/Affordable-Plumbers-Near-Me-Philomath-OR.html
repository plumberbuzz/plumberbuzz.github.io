<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping.

This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>

That way, you can easily tell if you have a gas leak.
