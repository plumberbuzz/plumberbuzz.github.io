<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
