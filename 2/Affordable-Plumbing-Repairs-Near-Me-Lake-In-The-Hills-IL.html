<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with securing people's lives and to a lower degree their home. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to attain that objective. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as a result suggest that the level of security on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high danger protection level.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
