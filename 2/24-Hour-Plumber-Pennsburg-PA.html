<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
