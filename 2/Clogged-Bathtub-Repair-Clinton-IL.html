<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Clinton IL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
