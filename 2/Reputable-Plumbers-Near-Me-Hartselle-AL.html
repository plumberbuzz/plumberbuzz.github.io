Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair.

PEX likewise resists deterioration and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending on your needs.</p>
