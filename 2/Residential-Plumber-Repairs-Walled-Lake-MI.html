<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
