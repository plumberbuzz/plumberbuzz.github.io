<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.

<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
