<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A functioning drainage and sewer system requires the correct installation of an experienced professional.

<p>Typically brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl.
