<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>If you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than regular (or perhaps more than as soon as), this is an indication you might need a toilet repair or replacement.
