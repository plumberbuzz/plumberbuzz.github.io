<p>An electrical inspection provides inspection services for all commercial and industrial structures, and verifies compliance with the electrical code. The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the appropriate electrical code in order to lower individual, and structural electrical risks. First call your local utility company then call a plumber if you suspect a gas leak.
