<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
