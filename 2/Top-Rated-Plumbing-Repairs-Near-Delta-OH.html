<p>No, you need to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
