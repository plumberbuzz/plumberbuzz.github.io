<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When utilized in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property.
