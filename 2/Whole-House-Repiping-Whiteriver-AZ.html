<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leakages and tighten up as essential. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as preferred.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water circulation. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
