<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Cape Elizabeth ME</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern water heaters likewise depend on electrical components. You might be left with no hot water if something inside the unit stops working The discharge line is pressurized and can run some distance. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain? Even a kitchen or bathroom sink drain will make much better connection than running outside.</p>
