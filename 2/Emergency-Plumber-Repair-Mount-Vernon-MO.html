<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
