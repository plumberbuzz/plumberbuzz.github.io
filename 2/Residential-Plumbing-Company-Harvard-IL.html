<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a house is because there is excessive hair in the shower drain.
