<h3>Drain Clearing in Dacula Georgia</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might be able to fully or partially remove copper, manganese, radium, and iron, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Note that copper can reenter the water after if passes and leaves the softener through your home's pipes and plumbing.
