<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. Since of the tight space, the pipes often make strange gurgling noises as water efforts to go through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, resulting in the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
