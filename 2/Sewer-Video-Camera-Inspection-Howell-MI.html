<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>There are 2 main kinds of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and lowered pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that everyone utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a great deal of water. In truth, it's an amount that can send out a flood of dollars out of your wallet if you're counting on a out-of-date or broken  water heater.</p>
