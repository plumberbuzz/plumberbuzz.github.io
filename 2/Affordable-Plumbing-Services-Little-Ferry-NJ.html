<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention problems.

The new pipes that are utilized are typically made of copper due to the fact that of their resilience and other factors. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
