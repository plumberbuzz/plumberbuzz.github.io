<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
