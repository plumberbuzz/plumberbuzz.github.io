<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
