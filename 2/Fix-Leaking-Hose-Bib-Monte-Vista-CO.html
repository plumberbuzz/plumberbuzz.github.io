<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
