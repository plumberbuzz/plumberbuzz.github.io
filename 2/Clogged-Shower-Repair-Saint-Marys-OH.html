<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, taste, color or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system.

The details we glean from the inspection enables us to make a notified choice regarding the condition of your pipes and advise the best option too.
