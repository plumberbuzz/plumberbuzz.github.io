<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
