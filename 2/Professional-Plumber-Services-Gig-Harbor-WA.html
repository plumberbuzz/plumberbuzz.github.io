<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated and offered for usage. Also, corrosion of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust.</p>
