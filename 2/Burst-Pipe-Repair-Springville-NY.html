<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by aligning it if you do not have a plumber's snake.

Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>If you see nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, discovered at the bottom of the system, and twist right and left. Examine that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button if the motor spins easily. If these steps don't work, and your disposer's warranty has actually ended, it's time to replace it.</p>
