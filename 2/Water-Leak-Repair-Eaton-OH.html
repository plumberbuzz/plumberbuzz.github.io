<p>You may be worried when you hear the words whole-house repiping. It seems like an enormous task. It is-- but this is why you employ professional plumbers to do the work. Whole-house repiping takes a few days, depending on the size of the house, but plumbers with the tools and abilities can make the work go smoothly and create as little disruption to your life as possible. And when the work is completed, you'll see a huge enhancement in your house: fewer obstructions, no water damage, lower water bills. The new plumbing needs to be there doing its job for decades.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Repair: Any problem involving the flush handle usually consists of a repair that plumbers can carry out easily.

<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
