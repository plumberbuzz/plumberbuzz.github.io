<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
