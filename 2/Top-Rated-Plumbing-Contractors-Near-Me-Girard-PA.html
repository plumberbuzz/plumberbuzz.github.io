<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply hot water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is warmed as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never be put down the waste disposal unit since they can impede the blades. Finally, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>
