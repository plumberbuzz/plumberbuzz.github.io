Procedure the height of your old hot water heater and buy a brand-new one the same height so you do not need to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing group does the job rapidly and economically.</p>
