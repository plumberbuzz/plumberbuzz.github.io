Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
