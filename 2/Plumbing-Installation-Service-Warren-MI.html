<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line.
