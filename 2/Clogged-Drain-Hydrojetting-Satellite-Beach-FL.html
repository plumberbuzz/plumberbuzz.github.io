<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Satellite Beach FL</h3>
<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you use PEX, copper, or another material. Changing galvanized pipes in older homes is very important since of the way galvanized pipes tend to deteriorate for many years. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc erodes, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
