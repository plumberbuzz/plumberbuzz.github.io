<p>Toilet repair is one of the most typical plumbing repairs performed in homes today. This is probably due to the fact that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the huge number of toilets, we have fixed many toilets in houses throughout the Tampa area so we are very familiar with the products used and how they are installed here locally. We also have done many toilet replacements as well; this is typically required when either a home owner decides to replace their toilet with maybe a more efficient one or when a toilet is simply beyond repair.</p>
