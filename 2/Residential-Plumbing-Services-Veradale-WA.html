<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

Usually, apprenticeship programs last anywhere from 4 to 5 years.</p>
