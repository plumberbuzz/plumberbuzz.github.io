<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
