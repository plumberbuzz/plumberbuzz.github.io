<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
