<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a steady and safe area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also examine to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
