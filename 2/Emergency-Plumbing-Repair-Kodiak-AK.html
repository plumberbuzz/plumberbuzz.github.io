<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
