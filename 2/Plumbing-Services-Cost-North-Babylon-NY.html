<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
