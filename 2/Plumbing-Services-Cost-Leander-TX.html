It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
