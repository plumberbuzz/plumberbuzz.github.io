<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas water heaters, electric hot water heater and tankless water heaters. Carefully flex the float arm down to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize lost water.</p>
