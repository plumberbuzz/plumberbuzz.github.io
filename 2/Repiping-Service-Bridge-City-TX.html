<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Bridge City TX</h3>

<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally salt. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
