<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.

A basic by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
