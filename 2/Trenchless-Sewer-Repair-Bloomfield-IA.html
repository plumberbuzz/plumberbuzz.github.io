<p>You live in an older home. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>You need to spend a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a durable surface system. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
