<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
