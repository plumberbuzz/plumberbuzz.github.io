The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
