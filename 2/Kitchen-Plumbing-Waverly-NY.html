<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
