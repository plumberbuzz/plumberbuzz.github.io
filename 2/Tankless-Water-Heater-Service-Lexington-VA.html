<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I have actually been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
