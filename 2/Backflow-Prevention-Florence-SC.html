<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 made use of to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and replaceable sections, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces.
