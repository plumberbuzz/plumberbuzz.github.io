<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
