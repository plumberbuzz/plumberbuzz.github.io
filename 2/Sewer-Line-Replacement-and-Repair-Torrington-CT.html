<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Our professional plumbers provide preventive maintenance, plumbing repairs and emergency maintenance When you ask for a preventative maintenance service call, you can anticipate us to completely inspect your plumbing pipes for signs of leaks, corrosion and malfunctioning or broken water-using appliances, like toilets, showers, sinks and water heaters. If our plumbers find any problems with your system, the problem will be explained to you and the correct repairs will be recommended.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can trigger typical flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be carried out on all drains, consisting of toilet, floor, sink and tub drains.</p>
