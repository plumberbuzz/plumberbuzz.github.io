<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is easy and cheap. However finding the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are often readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
