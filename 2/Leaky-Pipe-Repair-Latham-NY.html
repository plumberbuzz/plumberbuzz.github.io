This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that hazard, mercaptans are included into gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
