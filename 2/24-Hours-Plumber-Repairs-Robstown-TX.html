<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
