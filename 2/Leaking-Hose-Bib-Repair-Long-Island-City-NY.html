<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
