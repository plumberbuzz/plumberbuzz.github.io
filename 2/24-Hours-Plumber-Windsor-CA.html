For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak.
