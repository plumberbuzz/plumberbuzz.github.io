When these parts wear out, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye.

As rust and minerals develop with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
