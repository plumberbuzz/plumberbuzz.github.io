<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
