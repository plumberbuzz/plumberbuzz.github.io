<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
