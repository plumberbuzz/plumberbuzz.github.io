<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
