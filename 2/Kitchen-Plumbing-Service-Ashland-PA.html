<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>One common method for a house's water system to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.
