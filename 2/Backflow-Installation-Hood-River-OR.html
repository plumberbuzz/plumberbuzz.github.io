In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
