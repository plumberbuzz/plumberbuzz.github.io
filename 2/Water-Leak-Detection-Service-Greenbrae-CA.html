<p>Most normal single family home systems will not need supply piping larger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to expenditure as well as steel piping's propensity to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe gradually once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has deteriorated. In drinkable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic locations with destructive water contaminants.</p>
