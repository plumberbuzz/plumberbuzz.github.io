Sediment Build-Up: If you see odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Running out of hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
