<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You might need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
