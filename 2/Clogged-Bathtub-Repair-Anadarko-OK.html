<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components.

If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.
