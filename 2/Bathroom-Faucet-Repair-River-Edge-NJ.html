<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more breakable and vulnerable to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched.

Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary.
