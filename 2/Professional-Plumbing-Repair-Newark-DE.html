<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline.

As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
