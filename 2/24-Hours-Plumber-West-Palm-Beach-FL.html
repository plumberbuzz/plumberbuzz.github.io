<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and lowered pressure zone assemblies.
