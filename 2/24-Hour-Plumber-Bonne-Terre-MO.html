<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
