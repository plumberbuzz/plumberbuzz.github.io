Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be warmed and available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion.</p>
