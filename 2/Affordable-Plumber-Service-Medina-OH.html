<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
