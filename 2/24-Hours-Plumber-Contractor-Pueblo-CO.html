Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
