<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Blythe CA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>

Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly safeguarded, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
