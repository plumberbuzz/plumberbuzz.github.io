<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear.

<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can happen gradually from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes.
