<p>Sick of waiting for your sink to drain after every use? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Cooling at (913) 432-3342 and let our plumbing contractors assist with expert drain cleaning. Do you need to locate your water lines or get a new one put in? Perhaps it's time to replace an old one. No matter what your water lines need, our plumbers will get the task completed fast so you can proceed with your life.</p>
<p>This may seem like a joke, but it's extremely serious if you want to really get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection list. If you're getting a rough-in or last inspection on a building job or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make last changes prior to inspection day. Failing an examination can imply undesirable delays in your project.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if using one of these items.</p>
