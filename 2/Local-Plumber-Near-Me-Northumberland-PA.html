<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed.

These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
