<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
