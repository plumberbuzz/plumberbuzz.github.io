<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly.
