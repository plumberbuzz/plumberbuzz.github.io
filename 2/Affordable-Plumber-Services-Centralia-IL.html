Galvanized steel (frequently known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly costly, and challenging to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements usually discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.
