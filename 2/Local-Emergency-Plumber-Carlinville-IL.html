<p>We will carry out an extensive inspection of your home's pipes in order to figure out which service will be the very best fit.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
