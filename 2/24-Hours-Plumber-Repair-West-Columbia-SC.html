<h3>Bathroom Sink Leaking in West Columbia South Carolina</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller model that ran on the very same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
