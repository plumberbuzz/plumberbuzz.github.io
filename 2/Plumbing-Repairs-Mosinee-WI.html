<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Mosinee WI</h3>
<p>My technitions were taught to have the customer be present at time of video inspection! And for any factor they can not exist, We constantly video something identifiable to the customer before we insert camera into pipeline to perform the video inspection as well as our devices records in real time and audio and a foot counter to give approximate issue if any at all. We also supply client with sd card from video inspection.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
