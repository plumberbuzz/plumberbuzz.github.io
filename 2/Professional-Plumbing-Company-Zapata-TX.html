<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

The reasons for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or defective electrical circuitry, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed issues, a repair or replacement of the components may be sufficient. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening often, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
