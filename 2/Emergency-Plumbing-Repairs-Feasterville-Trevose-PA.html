<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the product. To keep your safety, home, and health comfort, we utilize just the very best piping: polyethylene. Lots of homes and organisations utilize galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to weaken and can negatively impact our health.

<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. Several homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't spotted quickly, obviously it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
