<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard defense assembly.</p>
