<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are often offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
