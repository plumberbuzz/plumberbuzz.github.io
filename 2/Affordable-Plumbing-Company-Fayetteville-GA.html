<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
