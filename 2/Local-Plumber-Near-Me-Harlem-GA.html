<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
