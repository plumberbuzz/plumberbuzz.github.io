<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
