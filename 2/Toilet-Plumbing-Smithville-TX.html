<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
