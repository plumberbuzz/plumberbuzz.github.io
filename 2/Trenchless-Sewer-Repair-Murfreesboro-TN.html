<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
