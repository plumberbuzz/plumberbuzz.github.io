Water conditioners do not successfully remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
