<p>After you have actually set up the unit, put a. stopper in the drain and fill the sink up with an inch of water. Examine below for any signs of leaks. You want to confirm that any seals you made are tight. Switch on the disposal during this step to ensure it runs properly. Gas Devices Malfunctioning: Another typical sign that your gas line may be damaged is if you notice the malfunctioning of home appliances in your house that are powered by gas. For instance, if your gas stove and hot water heater stop working at the same time, you probably have a gas line issue.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine problem. This type of camera is specifically useful in finding a problem if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
