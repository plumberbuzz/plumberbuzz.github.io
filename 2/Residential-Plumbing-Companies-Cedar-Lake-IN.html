<p>Household owned and operated since 2003, RT Plumbing Services provides industry-leading plumbing knowledge, home redesigning service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX neighborhood. Before setting up, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its install.
