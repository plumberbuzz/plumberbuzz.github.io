It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized.
