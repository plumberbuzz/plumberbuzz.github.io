<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
