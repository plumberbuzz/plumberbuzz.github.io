<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that hazard, mercaptans are added into gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
