The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; additional, more considerable costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for citizens. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
