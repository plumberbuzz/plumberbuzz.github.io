That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the proficiency to diagnose a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
