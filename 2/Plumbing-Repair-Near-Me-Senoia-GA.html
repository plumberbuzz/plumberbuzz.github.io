<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Senoia GA 30276</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise called tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>

You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to restore the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>

If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned prior to it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
