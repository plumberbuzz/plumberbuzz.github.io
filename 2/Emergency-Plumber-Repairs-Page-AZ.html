<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
