<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
