When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You have actually got a problem with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet continuously running is typical to you. This water is being dumped down the overflow tube wasting approximately 200 gallons of water each day. That takes a toll on your water expense, not to discuss the danger of a more serious leak that could ruin your house with flooding.</p>
