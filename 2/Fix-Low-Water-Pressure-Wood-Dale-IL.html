You need to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You need to also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F.
