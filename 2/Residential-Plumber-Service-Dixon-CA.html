<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping.
