Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
