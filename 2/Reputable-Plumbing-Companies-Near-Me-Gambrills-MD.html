<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more susceptible and fragile to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure.

The backflow prevention assembly need to be taken apart and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is required to ensure it was fixed properly. A correctly fixed assembly must provide years of security.</p>
