<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause blockages and jams - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain also.

You can then reheat and use for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
