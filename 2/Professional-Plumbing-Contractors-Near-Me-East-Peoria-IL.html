<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

It is extremely difficult to judge such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well adequate described to permit others to examine them and to confirm the outcomes.
