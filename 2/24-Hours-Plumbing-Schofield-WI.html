Like nearly everything in life, there's a bad and great side to both gas and electrical water heaters.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
