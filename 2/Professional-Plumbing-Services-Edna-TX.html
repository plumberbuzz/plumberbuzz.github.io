<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Edna TX</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
