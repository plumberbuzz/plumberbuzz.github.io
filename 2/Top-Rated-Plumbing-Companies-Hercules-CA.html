A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
