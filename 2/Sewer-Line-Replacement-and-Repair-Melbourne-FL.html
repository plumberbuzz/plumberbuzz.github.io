<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which might carry unclean water or other, harmful substances into the general public supply of water and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of circumstances that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is linked to any outdoors water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>It generally signifies rust and mineral accumulation if you notice low water pressure or stained water. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health danger in your water.</p>

Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
