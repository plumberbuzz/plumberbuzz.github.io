<p>If you have a septic system, then you might mistakenly believe that you can not have a waste disposal unit, and this is not real. Nevertheless, property owners with garbage disposals and septic systems may need to pump their septic more frequently.

The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
