<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Ardmore PA</h3>
<p>All of us experience a clogged drain eventually. You can try to take matters into your hands by using daily products, such as a plunger, a coat wall mount, or a snake. Some property owners will try to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
