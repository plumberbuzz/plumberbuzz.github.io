Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
