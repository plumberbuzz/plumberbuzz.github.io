<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, including bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and corrosion. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
