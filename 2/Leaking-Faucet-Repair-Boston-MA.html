<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
