<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
