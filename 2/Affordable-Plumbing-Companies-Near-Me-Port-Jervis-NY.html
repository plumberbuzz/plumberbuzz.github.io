The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places.

Assemblies not presently noted must have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>If you see absolutely nothing obvious, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the system, and twist best and left. If the motor spins easily, inspect that the breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button. If these measures don't work, and your disposer's guarantee has expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
