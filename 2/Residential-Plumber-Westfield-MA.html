<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a couple of choices if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage. The other is to go ahead and replace the whole line. If the line has to do with 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout, certainly replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate option to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an alternative.</p>
