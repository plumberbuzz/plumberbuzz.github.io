<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and duty are extremely important to developing a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water supply within a building these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
