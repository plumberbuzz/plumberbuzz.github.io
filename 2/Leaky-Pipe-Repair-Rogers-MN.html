<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great man. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
