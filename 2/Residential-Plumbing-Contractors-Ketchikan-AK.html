<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right now.

He also got the job done faster than initial estimated, so the work was less costly than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
