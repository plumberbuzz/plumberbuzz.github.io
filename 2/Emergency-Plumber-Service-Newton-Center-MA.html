<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
