<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures if using among these items.</p>
