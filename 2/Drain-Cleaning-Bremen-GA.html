<p>Backflow is bad news. The prevention of backflow pollutants into potable water systems is crucialÂ not just in industrial and commercial applications, but also in residential systems. Conbraco, Febco, and Wilkins are 3 of the biggest providers of industrial-grade backflow prevention assemblies.Â Control your water supply and pressure with a backflow preventer noted here.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Double Check although it might be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
