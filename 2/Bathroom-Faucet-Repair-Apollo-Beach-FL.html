<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself.

Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
