<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Nanuet NY</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas a smell often associated with rotten eggs. If it occurs, this distinct aroma enables you to smell a potential leak. Always leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>Was your house developed prior to the 1970s and has not undergone remodeling or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually rusted and rotted throughout the years. Older pipes can cause major leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
