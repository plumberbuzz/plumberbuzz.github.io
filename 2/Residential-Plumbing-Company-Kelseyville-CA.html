If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
