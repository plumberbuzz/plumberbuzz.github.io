<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse?

If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
