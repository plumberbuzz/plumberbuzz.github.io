<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is especially sensible to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when acquiring a new home.

<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you should most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
