Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes component itself. Obstructions in a fixture can trigger harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>

<p>The Plumbing Inspection Division is accountable for securing the water supply by ensuring, through strategy review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are also responsible for making sure the waste plumbing is appropriately vented and trapped so the plumbing safely carries waste away while triggering no illness.</p>
