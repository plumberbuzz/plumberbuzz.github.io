<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
