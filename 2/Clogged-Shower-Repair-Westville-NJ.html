<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
