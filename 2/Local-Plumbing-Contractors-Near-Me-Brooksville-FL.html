<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Brooksville FL</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
