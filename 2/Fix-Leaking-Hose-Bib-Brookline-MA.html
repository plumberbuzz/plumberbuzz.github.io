<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
