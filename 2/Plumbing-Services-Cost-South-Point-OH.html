Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
