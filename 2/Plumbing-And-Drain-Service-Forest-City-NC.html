<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this may be something to think about. A totally different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and offer a cautious cleaning.</p>
