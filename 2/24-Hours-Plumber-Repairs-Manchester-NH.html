Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust.</p>
