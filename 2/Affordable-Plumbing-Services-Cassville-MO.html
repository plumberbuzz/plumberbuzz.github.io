<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than products including harsh chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>There are various causes for clogs depending on where they take place in your plumbing Toilets clog from too much toilet tissue for the most part.
