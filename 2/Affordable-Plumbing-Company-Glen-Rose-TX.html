<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Glen Rose TX 76043</h3>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

The pilot light might need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is harmed, the flowers or vegetation near the gas leak will be stained or degraded. Contact our experts to identify the extent of the issue.</p>
