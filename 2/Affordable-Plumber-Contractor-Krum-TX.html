<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Krum TX</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
