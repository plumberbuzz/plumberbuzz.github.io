<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
