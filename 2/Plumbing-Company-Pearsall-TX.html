It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will determine the extent of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
