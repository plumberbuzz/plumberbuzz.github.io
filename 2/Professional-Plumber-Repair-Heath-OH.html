<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
