<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
