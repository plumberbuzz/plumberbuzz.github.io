It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
