If, state, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
