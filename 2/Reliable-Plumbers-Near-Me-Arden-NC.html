<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
