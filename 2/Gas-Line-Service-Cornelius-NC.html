<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
