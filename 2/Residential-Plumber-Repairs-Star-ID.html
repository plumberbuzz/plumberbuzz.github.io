Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>

<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes.

If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
