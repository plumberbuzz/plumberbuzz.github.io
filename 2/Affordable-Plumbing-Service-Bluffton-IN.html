<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system providing the make-up water.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
