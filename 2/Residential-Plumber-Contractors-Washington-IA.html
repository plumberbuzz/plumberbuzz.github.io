<p>The most efficient way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Toilets are hard things to understand. They've been developed practically the exact same method for hundreds of years, so you can't really tell how old they are. It might not work effectively all the time, but you can't tell if that's typical or not. Plus, there's that universal but never unacknowledged sensation that it's you-you're somehow doing something incorrect in there.</p>
