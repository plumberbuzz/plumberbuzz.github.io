Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
