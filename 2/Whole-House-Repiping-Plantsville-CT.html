Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious signs of deterioration, demand that a new one be set up.</p>
