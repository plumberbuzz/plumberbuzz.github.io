<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, however its steep price makes it not practical as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, sometimes, include phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
