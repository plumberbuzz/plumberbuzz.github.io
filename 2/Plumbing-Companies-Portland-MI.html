<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
