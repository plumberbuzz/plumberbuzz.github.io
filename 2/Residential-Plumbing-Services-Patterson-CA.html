It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
