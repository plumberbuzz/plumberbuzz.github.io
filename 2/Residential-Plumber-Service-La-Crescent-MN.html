<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
