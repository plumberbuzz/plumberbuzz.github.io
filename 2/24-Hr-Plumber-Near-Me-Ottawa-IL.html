A water heater is generally a household device that includes a gas or electrical heating unit under a tank in which water is heated and stored. You do not need a plumbing permit for simple repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing permit is issued as part of a larger residential building permit or commercial structure license.</p>
<p>Buying a home is a big financial investment. Knowing if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be handy when negotiating the sale of a house. There are so many kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's a great idea to get an entire house plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Gas lines undoubtedly need repairs-- age and use will eventually use them down. Though typical, it's still stressful to a house owner, who may fear the trouble of working with a service professional to manage their (potentially) costly repairs quickly and effectively. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections make sure you are aware of every potential gas line concern, and our repairs ensure your system is working completely once again.</p>
