<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Butner NC 27509</h3>
<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with difficult water, you may not realize how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
