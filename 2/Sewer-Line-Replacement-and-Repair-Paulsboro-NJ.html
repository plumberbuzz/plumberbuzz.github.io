<p>There's a great chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who sets up gas piping on property not under their ownership need to possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a permit and inspection.</p>
