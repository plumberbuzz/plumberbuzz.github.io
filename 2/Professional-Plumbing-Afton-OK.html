<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
