<p>The traditional hot water heater has a tank that is filled with constantly heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not presently in use.

<p>Hard water stops washing cleaning agents and cosmetic cleansers from working as successfully. When washing items are used in tough water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. Any place where water is contained is vulnerable to clogged drains. Since of the amount of use they get and all the various things that we put down them, your drainpipes are especially susceptible to obstructions and other clogs. No matter what's blocking your drain, the professional plumbers at Larry & Sons can clear it with ease.</p>
