It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.
