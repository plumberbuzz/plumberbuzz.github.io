<p>You may be concerned when you hear the words whole-house repiping. It seems like a huge task. It is-- but this is why you work with professional plumbers to do the work. Whole-house repiping takes a few days, depending on the size of your home, but plumbers with the skills and tools can make the work go efficiently and produce as little interruption to your life as possible. And as soon as the work is completed, you'll see a huge enhancement in your house: less obstructions, no water damage, lower water costs.

In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
