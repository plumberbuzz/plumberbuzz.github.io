<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, figuring out. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
