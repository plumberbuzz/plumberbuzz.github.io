Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
