<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you must most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
